# Three platforms: what was verified, and what went wrong on the way

One section per phase. Mistakes stay in, because they are the part that is expensive to rediscover.

## P1 - the first minute works

### The preset, applied the way the panel applies it (integration tests)

`tests/integration/preset.spec.ts`, three tests against the real store, the real policy store and
the real ingestion service:

- on a store that has recorded nothing, an allowed editor is refused before the preset and stored
  after it;
- a protected application (1Password) is still refused after the preset, and the refusal is counted
  as `protected-app`;
- an application outside the preset is still refused, and nothing is stored.

### The first-run screen, on a clean store

```bash
npm install --prefix /tmp/dsh-cli-020 @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2   # the same version as the app
cp -R ~/.dsh/profiles/web ~/.dsh/profiles/firstrun                   # a profile of my own
dsh plugin --profile firstrun add ./dsh-computer-history-<version>.tgz
# add it to the profile's "bundles", then:
/tmp/dsh-cli-020/node_modules/.bin/dsh --profile firstrun --port 19420 --no-open
```

Evidence: `docs/assets/panel-firstrun-clean-store.png` - the sidebar entry **Computer History**, and a
panel whose first section is 从这里开始: what will be recorded, what never will be, the preset in the
interface's language, and one button (开始记录).

### Eleven rounds lost to a version mismatch, and how it hid

The panel registers `main` and `sidebar.panellist`. Those slots exist in **0.2.0-rc.2** (the app) and
not in **0.1.2-rc.1** (what `dsh` on `PATH` installs). A Host booted from the older CLI has no such
slot, so the registration silently does nothing - and every symptom pointed at the plugin: the client
bundle was in `window.__DSH_BOOT__.entries`, its request returned **200**, no exception was thrown,
and nothing rendered.

Two hypotheses were falsified on the way and are worth keeping: "the interface does not know about
the client half" (it does), and "the vision-router plugin is a valid control" (it registers different
slots, so it was not).

**The rule that would have saved the eleven rounds: check the Host's version against the interface's
before concluding anything about the plugin.**

### The first minute, end to end, without a terminal

Done on a store that had never recorded anything, through the interface only:

1. open the panel (`Computer History` in the sidebar) - the first section is 从这里开始;
2. press **开始记录** - the panel applies the preset through `/policy`;
3. work for about a minute in an allowed application;
4. the timeline has a row.

Measured either side of step 2:

```text
policy before   only built-in rules (protection), nothing allowed
policy after    34 rules, 22 of them allow
first-run       the 从这里开始 section disappears, because a user rule now exists
/recent         [] before the minute, one episode after it
episode         Applications: com.apple.Terminal   resource: file:///Users/ysradmin (directory)
summary         "Recent computer activity. Observed resources: - ysradmin Applications: com.apple.Terminal"
```

Evidence: `docs/assets/panel-first-row.png`.

**Honest about the quality of that first row**, because "a row appeared" is not the same as "useful":

- the resource is the terminal's **working directory**, not a file - a terminal has no document, so a
  file needs an editor in the foreground;
- the duration is **0 ms**: one sample, because the observation arrived at the edge of the wait. The
  acceptance says "work for a minute", and a minute of *sampling* is what produces a duration;
- the earlier attempt produced nothing at all, and the reason is worth keeping: the collector records
  the **frontmost** application, and `open -a Finder` moved no focus, so the machine appeared idle.
  The refusal breakdown was empty, which is correct - nothing had been refused, nothing had arrived.

So P1's third item is **met in the narrow sense** (the path works and a row appears without touching
the terminal) and **not yet met in the useful sense** (an application, a file, and a duration). The
next pass should repeat it with an editor in the foreground for longer, and if the row is still
0 ms, look at the sampling interval rather than at the panel.
